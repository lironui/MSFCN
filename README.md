# Multi-Scale Fully Convolutional Network

In this repository, we design two branches with convolutional layers in different kernel sizes in each layer of the encoder to capture multi-scale features. Besides, a channel attention block and a global pooling module are utilized to enhance channel consistency and global contextual consistency. Substantial experiments are conducted on both 2D RGB images datasets and 3D spatial-temporal datasets.

The detailed results can be seen in the [Land Cover Classification from Remote Sensing Images Based on Multi-Scale Fully Convolutional Network](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2009/2009.02130.pdf).
